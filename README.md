# Python Codewars Solutions

Welcome to my repository of solutions for Codewars challenges in Python! This repository contains a collection of solutions I developed to enhance my programming skills and tackle challenging problems.

## About Codewars

[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is an online platform that offers coding challenges (called \"katas\") in various languages. The challenges are designed to help programmers of all levels improve their skills.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by difficulty levels (Kyu):

    ├── 8-Kyu
    │   ├── kata1.py
    │   ├── kata2.py
    │   └── ...
    ├── 7-Kyu
    │   ├── kata1.py
    │   ├── kata2.py
    │   └── ...
    ├── 6-Kyu
    │   ├── kata1.py
    │   ├── kata2.py
    │   └── ...
    └── ...


Each folder contains solutions to challenges corresponding to its difficulty level.

## How to Run the Solutions

To run a solution, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can execute the scripts directly from the command line:

```
python3 /8-Kyu/kata1.py
```
